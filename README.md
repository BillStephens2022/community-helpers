# Community Helpers

## Description
Community Helper is a web application built with NextJS, React, TypeScript, MongoDB, Mongoose. It uses Recoil for global state management and Cloudinary for image storage and transformations.  This application matches neighbors with skills with neighbors in need. Work Contracts can be created and faux payments can be made between parties to satisfy the contracts.  Users can contact one another via messages re: new jobs, etc.  Work Contacts can be proposed, negotiated, and signed off by both parties.
